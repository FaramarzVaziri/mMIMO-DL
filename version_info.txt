- the phase noised loss functione is now fully serialized and there is no map_fn anywhere in the loss and datagenerator functions








-to deal with the large Lambda matrix issue (102400*50*4*4*4*32/1e9 = 10 Gbits) in the dataset generation step,
 I just produce lambda only for the batches on the test dataset when I want to measure the test error and then
 produce H_tilde_0 and feed the trained network with that and measure performance in presence of phase noise

-In summary, now I train using only the phase noise free channel (H) and phase noise free loss function to 
train and every 10 epochs I do two tests 1) loss_phase_noise_free(H_tilde_0) and 2) loss_phased_noised(H_tilde_0)

- In this version, I also create the code for producing box charts
- I am also uncertain about using tf.funciton and tf.map_fn
